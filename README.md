# KNN with MaxHeap Implement

## Introduction of the file

### dataset
I just choose two classes of the iris dataset. You can see it in the .csv file.

### KNN.py
This is the K Nearest Neighbor module. I combine them in a class. 

I also write some function document in this file. You can run it to see them.

### maxheap.py
In this file, I establish a big root binary heap to optimize the KNN algorithm. You can run it to see the performance.

As for the binary heap, you can learn it in some blogs.

### main.py
It includes all the processes of the project, such as the data pre-processing, data visualization, and the training, validation and score computation of the KNN model.

Actually, the K is a hyper parameter of the KNN algorithm.

You can run the main.py file and see the Fig4. According to it, you may choose the best K of this dataset.
